**ReScan** is an advanced iOS application designed for high-fidelity 3D scanning and photogrammetry. It seamlessly captures synchronized LiDAR depth data, confidence maps, camera tracking (odometry), and high-resolution RGB video. It natively exports data in the **Stray Scanner format**, making it instantly compatible with popular SfM (Structure from Motion) and Gaussian Splatting pipelines like COLMAP/GLOMAP.

## ✨ Features

- **Professional Camera Controls**: 
  - Manual Exposure (Shutter Speed, ISO, EV Compensation) 
  - Manual Focus.
  - Custom Capture FPS (1 to 60 FPS) via frame subsampling for efficient photogrammetry (Datas are recorded at 60 FPS and then subsampled during the recording process)
- **High-End Video Formats**: 
  - **Apple Log (ProRes 422 HQ)** recording for maximum color grading flexibility (requires iPhone 15 Pro or newer)
  - HDR HEVC & Standard HEVC for efficient storage
- **LiDAR Integration**: Captures highly accurate 16-bit depth maps (in millimeters) and 8-bit confidence maps.
- **Odometry & Tracking**: Natively exports ARKit camera poses (`odometry.csv`) and intrinsics (`camera_matrix.csv`).
- **Real-Time Visualization**: View RGB, Depth, Confidence, and live AR Mesh overlays while capturing.
- **On-Device Mesh Export**: Reconstructs and saves the ARKit scene mesh as an `.obj` file alongside your capture.

## 🚀 Installation

ReScan uses advanced ARKit and AVFoundation capabilities, so it must be sideloaded onto your iOS device.

To make things **extremely easy and turnkey**, we provide automated installation scripts to set up AltStore and sideload the app on Windows and Linux.

### Prerequisites
- An iOS device with a **LiDAR scanner** (iPhone 12 Pro or newer, iPad Pro 2020 or newer).
- iOS/iPadOS **17.0** or later.
- The `ReScan.ipa` file (download from Releases or build yourself).

### Method 1: Turnkey Installation (Windows & Linux)

**For Windows Users:**
We provide a 1-click PowerShell script that automatically downloads AltServer and opens the direct download links for its Apple dependencies.
1. Right-click on `install_altstore.ps1` and select **Run with PowerShell**.
2. The script will guide you to install iTunes and iCloud (direct versions, not Microsoft Store).
3. It will automatically download, extract, and launch the AltServer installer.
4. Once installed, launch AltServer, connect your iPhone, and use it to sideload the ReScan IPA!

**For Linux Users:**
We provide an automated bash script that installs all necessary dependencies (`usbmuxd`, `libimobiledevice`), downloads AltServer-Linux, and pairs your device.
1. Open a terminal and run the script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install_altstore.sh
   ./install_altstore.sh
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions. The script will find the IPA in the folder and can install it directly via USB, or start Server Mode for installation directly from your phone.

### Method 2: Build via Xcode (Mac / Developers)
If you are on a Mac, you can easily deploy it using Xcode (Free Developer Account):
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/YvigUnderscore/ReScan.git`
2. **Open**: `ReScan.xcodeproj`.
3. **Configure Signing**: In the Project settings -> Target `ReScan` -> Signing & Capabilities, select your Personal Team and change the Bundle Identifier.
4. **Deploy**: Connect your iPhone, hit **Cmd + R** to run.
5. **Trust the Developer**: On your device, go to **Settings > General > VPN & Device Management**, tap your Apple ID and select "Trust".

*Note: With a free Apple Developer account, apps expire after 7 days and need to be re-deployed.*

## 📁 Output Format (Stray Scanner Compatible)

ReScan organizes each capture session into a standard Stray Scanner directory structure, located in the app's Documents folder (accessible via the iPhone's Files app under "On My iPhone" > ReScan).

```text
scan_20260225_153022/
│
├── rgb.mov                 # Or rgb.mp4 (RGB Video - ProRes/Apple Log or HEVC)
├── camera_matrix.csv       # 3x3 Camera Intrinsics
├── odometry.csv            # Camera translations and quaternions
├── mesh.obj                # Reconstructed ARKit scene mesh
│
├── depth/

└── confidence/
    ├── 000000.png          # 8-bit PNG (0=Low, 127=Med, 255=High)
    ├── 000001.png
    └── ...
```

This structure is directly consumable by tools like `stray_to_colmap.py` for immediate reconstruction without complex preprocessing.

## ⚙️ Usage Tips for Photogrammetry

- **FPS**: 30 or 60 FPS is often overkill and creates massive datasets. Go to Settings and lower the **Capture FPS** to 2 or 5 FPS for standard scanning.
- **Color Space**: If using an iPhone 15 Pro+, enable **Apple Log (ProRes)** in settings. This flat color profile retains maximum dynamic range and avoids highlight clipping, which is crucial for high-quality Gaussian Splatting and NeRFs.
- **Exposure**: Use **Lock** exposure mode once you have a good exposure to prevent brightness shifting between frames, which can confuse feature matching algorithms.
- **Moving Speed**: Move slowly and smoothly. ARKit tracks at 30/60fps internally for stability, but motion blur from fast movement will degrade the RGB frames.
